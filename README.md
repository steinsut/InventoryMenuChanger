# InventoryMenuChanger
## Precursor to InventoryDeclutter

A mod for when there are too many buttons in your inventory.

This codebase is terribly unfinished. I just uploaded however much I had finished without even removing all the debug stuff.

If this mod interests you (how did you even find this before the actually clean one?) check the repo below instead.
